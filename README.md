## Configuration

### Neovim

The [code editor](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) I will be using for probably the rest of my life.
The [language server protocol](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig) which are responsible for the autocompletion and autoformatting are made possible by lua.

### Windows Manager 

The one I will be using for now is [i3](https://i3wm.org/), fully configured to my likings. I might try xmonad or dwm later in the future.

### Login Manager

The one I'm using at the moment is [lightDM](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/LightDM). It allows me to directly login to my i3 session without having to further configure my xorg files.

### rofi

I use [it](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/LightDM) for launching my applications and accessing my powermenu.

### polybar

The bn   top of my screen which shows me important information about my system, workspace, time, etc.
