# Configuration

## Neovim

The code editor I will be using for probably the rest of my life.
The language server protocol which are responsible for the autocompletion and autoformatting are made possible by lua.

## Windows Manager 

The one I will be using for now is i3, fully configured to my likings. I might try xmonad or dwm later in the future.

## Login Manager

The one I'm using at the moment is lightDM. It allows me to directly login to my i3 session without having to further configure my xorg files.

## rofi

I use it for launching my applications and accessing the powermenu.

## polybar

The bar on top of my screen which shows me important information about my system, workspace, time, etc.

## ranger

a file manager which allows previewing.

## Terminal

The terminal emulator I'm using is called alacritty and the shell script is zsh.
